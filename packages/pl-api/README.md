A JavaScript library for interacting with Mastodon API-compatible servers, focused on support for projects extending the official Mastodon API.

`pl-api` attempts to abstract out the implementation details when supporting different backends, implementing the same features in different ways. It uses [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) to ensure type safety and normalize API responses.

Example:

```ts
import { PlApiClient, type CreateApplicationParams } from 'pl-api';

const { ACCESS_TOKEN } = process.env;

const client = new PlApiClient('https://mastodon.example/', ACCESS_TOKEN, {
  fetchInstance: true,
  onInstanceFetchSuccess: () => console.log('Instance fetched'),
});

await client.statuses.createStatus({
  status: 'Hello, world!',
  language: 'en',
});
```

Some sort of documentation is available on https://pl.mkljczk.pl/pl-api-docs

> This project should be considered unstable before the 1.0.0 release. I will not provide any changelog or information on breaking changes until then.

## Supported projects

Currently, `pl-api` includes compatibility definitions for 12 independent Mastodon API implementations and 5 variants of them (like, forks). As the combination of software name and version is not the only way `pl-api` infers feature availability, some feature definitions will also work on other software.

For unsupported projects, it falls back to a basic feature set, though every method of PlApiClient may be used anyway.

## Projects using `pl-api`

- [Nicolium](https://codeberg.org/mkljczk/nicolium/src/branch/develop/packages/pl-fe) is a web client for Mastodon-compatible servers forked from Soapbox. It uses `pl-api` for API interactions.
- [`pl-hooks`](https://codeberg.org/mkljczk/nicolium/src/branch/develop/packages/pl-hooks) is a work-in-progress library utilizing `pl-api`.
