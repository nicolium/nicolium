# Changelog

## Unreleased

Changes made since the project forked from Soapbox in April 2024.

### Major changes

- Switched to a separate library [`pl-api`](https://github.com/mkljczk/pl-fe/tree/develop/packages/pl-api) for Mastodon API integration. It is mostly written from scratch, inheriting minor code parts from Soapbox/Mastodon. This also comes with improved compatibility with various Mastodon API extensions and abstracts out the implementation details.

### Added

**Behavior:**
- Notifications of the same type and reposts of the same post are grouped client-side.
- Date is displayed fobr notifications that are not about new posts.
- Replies to your posts are displayed differently to other mentions in notification list.
